## Sessions and State Management in ADK

This example demonstrates how to create and manage stateful sessions in the Agent
Development Kit (ADK), enabling your agents to maintain context and remember user
information across interactions.

## What Are Sessions in ADK?

Sessions in ADK provide a way to:

1. **Maintain State**: Store and access user data, preferences, and other information
   between interactions
2. **Track Conversation History**: Automatically record and retrieve message history
3. **Personalize Responses**: Use stored information to create more contextual and
   personalized agent experiences

## Running the Example

In the .venv (cmd) virtual environment move

```bash
cd 5-sessions-and-state

python basic_stateful_session.py

```
